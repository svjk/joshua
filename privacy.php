<p>This website and app including all services offered hereon (collectively, the “Site”), is owned and operated by “Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra” under the brand Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra (collectively, “Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra” or “We” )</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra is firmly committed to the security and protection of the personal integrity of our Users of the Services (as defined in the Terms of Service) and their contacts. This Privacy Policy describes what personal information You may share with Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra, as data controller, and other Users when activating and using the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Services, how Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra receives, collects and uses this data and how You may opt-out at any time, altogether preventing use of the data shared via the Services.</p>

<h4>Information Collected and Received?</h4>
<h4>Installation and Use</h4>

<p>When you install and use the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps, Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra will collect, process and retain personal information from You and any devices You may use in Your interaction with our Services. This information may include the following: geo-location, Your IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device manufacturer and type, device and hardware settings, ID for advertising, ad data, operating system, operator, IMSI, connection information, screen resolution, usage statistics, device log and event information, version of the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps You use and other information based on Your interaction with our Services. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may use the information collected from, and in connection with, all of our services to provide, maintain, and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra and its users. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra also uses this information to provide you with tailored content, such as search results and advertisements more relevant to You.</p>

<h4>User Profile</h4>

<p>Where the User registers a user profile in the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps and via SMS or inbound call verification confirms being the holder of a certain number, the information up-loaded to the profile section of the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps will be received and stored by Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra until the User changes or deletes such data or terminates the Services. Compulsory information when creating a profile page is the User’s first name, last name and phone number and additional information that may be provided at the User’s option include, but is not limited to, photo, gender, school, scores in examinations, street address and zip code, country of residence, email address, professional website, Facebook page, Twitter address and a short status message. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may supplement the information provided or collected with information from third parties and add it to information provided by You. For example, collection and use of demographic information that is publicly available and additional contact information as allowed by applicable national laws.</p>

<p>Please note that any content uploaded to and displayed in the user profile by the User is not moderated by Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra and is not protected under the laws of State of Karnataka. The User is solely liable for the publication of such content. Please see the Terms of Use for further information regarding protection under the laws of State of Karnataka.</p>

<h4>Identifiers</h4>

<p>In addition, You may provide us with Your user identifier information regarding certain third party services, i.e. Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter, necessary for the application to interoperate with such third party services. In that case Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra will store and process also that information (and also a mapped photo where applicable), for as long as You use the Services and will not use this information for any other purpose than required in order to obtain interoperability and functionality in relation to such third party services. Please note that we never store any passwords to the mentioned third party services.</p>

<h4>Contact Information</h4>

<p>Where the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps are obtained from other sources than Apple App Store or Google Play, You may share the names, numbers and email addresses contained in Your device’s address book (“Contact Information”) with Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra for the purpose described below under Study Group. If you provide us with personal information about someone else, you confirm that they are aware that You have provided their data and that they consent to our processing of their data according to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Where the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps are obtained from Apple App Store or Google Play, we will only use permitted Contact Information to make our Services more relevant to You and Your engagement with the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra community.</p>

<p>In addition to Contact Information, if You choose to activate use of a third party social network service, such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn or Twitter, within the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps, Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may up-load, store and use the list of identifiers associated with said services linked to the Contact Information in order to enhance the results shared with other Users.</p>

<p>Please note that no other Contact Information than the phone numbers and thereto attached names and email addresses will be received, stored and used from the User’s address book. Other numbers or information that may be contained in your device’s phone book will be filtered away and will therefore not be stored or used by Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra. Addresses, passwords and credit card numbers and any other similar information will automatically be prevented from being entered into the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra database by our safety algorithms, that filters any numbers and other information stored in the phone book in a number sequence not compatible with that used for telephone numbers. Please also note that You can always choose not to share Contact Information with Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra and if You have shared information and changed Your mind, You can easily delist Your number or opt-out to render your entire Contact Information unavailable for search in the database for Study Group.</p>

<h4>SAFETY AND SECURITY</h4>

<p>As part of Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra we take the following steps to ensure the safety and security of all students accessing online tutoring through Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online tutors will never have any physical or audible interaction with a student.</li>
<li>Online tutoring services are provided only through streaming online chat provided by the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra App.</li>
<li>All Online tutoring chat sessions are recorded and parents have access to the playback of these sessions for up to six months from the date of recording.</li>
<li>Online tutors do not have any personal information about the students, including any information that could be used to contact the student either online or offline such as email address, physical address or phone numbers.</li>
<li>Only students can initiate the online tutoring chat sessions through registration and login from the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra App. Online tutors can not initiate tutor services or otherwise initiate any contact with students.</li>
<li>Students logging in are assigned an online tutor at random for each online tutoring session. Students are not paired with any specific tutor.
Online tutors are all trained and follow a defined code of conduct in appropriate online conduct strictly related to the academic tutoring of the student.</li>
<li>Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra conducts spot monitoring of online tutoring to ensure quality and safety. Customer Service is available for any issues or complaints on the quality or nature of the online tutoring.
Use, Sharing and Disclosure of User and Contact Information</li>
</ul>
<p>Information related to the User or Contact Information will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) display the name associated with a certain number at a manual number search against the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra database,</li>
<li>(b) provide selected Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra partners with limited information in order to enhance user experience, service functionality and data accuracy, provided that these partners adhere to strict confidentiality provisions no less protective of your rights than the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy,</li>
<li>(c) contact You from Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra for verification purposes or with information pertaining to the Services, e.g. newsletter e-mails and similar notifications, and verify provided User Profile information with third party providers,</li>
<li>(d) enable You to use and share Your user information in connection with Your use of third party services,</li>
<li>(e) customize, maintain, measure, improve our Services and develop new ones,</li>
<li>(f) personalize, measure and improve our advertising and use geo-location information to provide You with location based information and services (such as more relevant advertising, search results and other personalized content).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Study Group functionality and database</h4>

<p>To improve the Services, Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra has created a searchable database where the Users generate the content and via the Study Group functionality are offered access to this database, containing Contact Information from those Users who permit such aggregation. In return these Users are allowed to access to the database by querying it. Queries against the database are only allowed through the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Services by Users who have explicitly approved of the Service’s functionality and integrity restrictions as contained in the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Terms of Use, the API License Addendum and this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The queries against the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Study Group database are processed only if a numeric phone number is attributed to the query and only if no results are published by an associated or partnering database of Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra. The response given to the queried number will be the associated name to that number, if any name is available.</p>

<p>It is important to notice the following distinctions. As an integrity and security measure, only numeric queries are allowed against the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra database for Study Group, i.e. there will be no result to a name query. Name searches may, however, give result via the Services if a partnering or associated database to Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra has numbers available to the name queries. The Users contributing to Study Group can therefore rely on that the Contact Information provided, as a personal integrity precaution, will not enable anyone searching for the number to a certain person direct access to that number. In some cases, Users may, however, use the Services to forward a request to a named person in order to get in touch, please see below about the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Refer service.</p>

<p>The database may also – via a “social graph” algorithm – be used to show the User what other Users he or she, directly or indirectly, has in common with another User and to suggest other contacts they may have in common. Please note that, if You are presented as a person that the User who made the query may know or as a “similar” person, some of Your profile information entered by you, excluding phone number, will be disclosed to such User.</p>

<h4>Refer</h4>

<p>Your name and telephone number and any other information You choose to submit on Your User Profile will be visible to the person You reach out to when requesting a contact via the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Refer service. Your request will be forwarded to that person via an SMS or any other sharing platform</p>

<h4>Opt-Out and Delist Numbers</h4>

<p>If a User chooses to disable the Study Group functionality, the Contact Information made available by that User is disabled and will thereafter not be accessible for queries. If any persons do not wish to have their names and phone numbers made available through the Study Group or Refer functionalities, they can exclude themselves from further queries by notifying Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra via its website at www.Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra.com or as set forth in the contact details below.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>In addition to the above Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may disclose information related to the Users and Contact Information if we believe such action is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</li>
<li>(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</li>
<li>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or members of the public.
Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may share Your personal data with trusted third party service providers and partners. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a description of how Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may share information about You with trusted third party partners:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra uses a third party partner company in order to send You or a third party you wish to contact SMS when you use the Services. In order to send you the SMS, we send the third party company Your and the relevant third party’s phone numbers. This third party SMS partner is contractually obligated only to use these phone numbers for the transmission of requested SMS.</li>
<li>2. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may use Push Notification Services to notify you about up-dates and important information. In such cases, Your phone number may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to Your device. You may, however, at any time-opt out or disable push notifications in the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps.</li>
<li>3. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may allow you to use third party services to create your user profile or log in to use our Services, share information with such third parties, or to connect your user profile with the respective third parties. Those third parties may automatically provide us with access to certain personal information retained by them about You (e.g., content viewed by you, content liked by You and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on). You control the personal information You allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on the respective third party service and the permissions You give us when You grant us access to the personal information about You retained by the respective third party service. By associating an account managed by a third party with Your Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra user profile and authorizing us to have access to this information, You agree that we may collect, use and retain the information provided by these third party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>4. For the provision of free versions of the Services, Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may also collaborate with a few selected third party advertising networks, which in such case may be provided limited information related to the freemium User’s device (but no other User or Contact Information).</li>
<li>5. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra, or a third party on its behalf, may collect and use your email address, telephone number and ID for advertising (including, but not limited to, content viewed by you, content you have commented on and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on) through the Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra Apps and share this information with third party advertisers and networks. Such third parties may use this information and information collected from other sources in order to provide measurement services and targeted ads. You can limit or opt-out of the collection and use of Your information for ad targeting by third parties via Your device settings.
The submission of Contact Information by You and the processing thereof by Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra is constitutionally protected under the applicable law, see the Terms of Use. Swami Vivekananda Jnana Kendra may, however, disclose information contained in the Service and about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary, always provided, of course, it is also lawful.</li>
</ul>
